# AdventCalendarOfCode

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Since I'm on break from college classes for the rest of the month of Decemeber and beginning of January, I thought this would be something super fun to do! And something to keep my coding skills fresh!

I am really excited to attempt to complete them!

I will be doing it in mostly Java, but maybe a little bit of python to help me learn python a little bit more!
