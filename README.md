# AdventCalenderOfCode

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.


Since I'm on break from college classes for the rest of the month of decemeber and beginning of January, I thought this would be something super fun to do! And something to keep my coding skills fresh!

I am really excited to try all of these.....

They will be all documented in this Repo, even if I don't finish them! I will definitely try to make the optimal solution but they may not be perfect!

WOOOOOOOOOOO
